Hi, this is my 1st post on my 1st blog. I've wanted to have a blog for long time, mainly to de used has my personal wiki. The time has come. The main purpose is to document some of the time consuming things I do, so I can reference to them later.

The blog is using [HUGO](https://gohugo.io/), the theme I'm using is [Cactus](https://themes.gohugo.io/cactus/). For now the blog will be hosted in AWS S3. Later on probably I'll be moving it into AWS CloudFront + S3 and create some sort of pipeline to deploy new articles to the blog.

For now this it. See you soon.
